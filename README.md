# Reddit BOT Script

I tried to create a reddit bot script with sentiment analysis

# HOW THIS WORKS?
 - Install the requirements 
 - Create a copy of setting.yaml as settings.local.yml 
 - Add your credentials in the credential columns
 - Add the trigger word to wakeup the bot
 - Add the subreddits where you want this bot to work and where you don't want this bot to work
